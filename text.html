scene Petro drives Catherina to her apartment.
She gives him her thanks for the meal and the drink
afterward in the bar. Petro offers to take her
to another bar for a last drink, but Catherina says
she wants to feel in good form the next day and
prefers to go directly to her apartment.</p>

<p id="mwAw">Petro tries to persuade her to invite him up for
some coffee, but Catherina obviously doesn't want
to risk a romantic encounter this evening. Petro
then suggests that they go out the next evening,
but Catherina does not want to commit herself to
anything. They say good night to each other, and
Peter goes away.</p>

<p id="mwBA">Catherina: Well, thanks a lot for inviting me to
go out with you this evening, Petro.</p>

<p id="mwBQ">Petro: It was a pleasure.</p>

<p id="mwBg">Catherina: The restaurant was excellent. And the
cabaret also was very pleasant.</p>

<p id="mwBw">Petro: We can go get a nightcap, if you want.
There are other bars in this area.</p>

<p id="mwCA">Catherina: No, I think I oughtta go to my apartment.</p>

<p id="mwCQ">Petro: Really?</p>

<p id="mwCg">Catherina: Yes. I don't want to be hung over
tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwCw">Petro: Okay.</p>

<p id="mwDA">Catherina: I'm very sorry that you weren't able
to dance.</p>

<p id="mwDQ">Petro: Oh, that wasn't very important. We can
do it some other time.</p>

<p id="mwDg">Catherina: Fine. Good night and thanks once again.</p>

<p id="mwDw">Petro: You're not going to invite me up to your
apartment for some coffee?</p>

<p id="mwEA">Catherina: No. I don't think that it would be
a good idea since it's so late.</p>

<p id="mwEQ">Petro: That isn't very nice.</p>

<p id="mwEg">Catherina: I'm very sorry, but some coffee could
easily lead to something else, and ...</p>

<p id="mwEw">Petro: And what would be bad about that?</p>

<p id="mwFA">Catherina: No. I hope that you will understand
that I have to get a good night's sleep with all
that we will be having to do tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwFQ">Petro: Can we go out together once again tomorrow
evening?</p>

<p id="mwFg">Catherina: Maybe. Let's discuss that tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwFw">Petro: Very well.</p>

<p id="mwGA">Catherina: So I'll see you in the office tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwGQ">Petro: Yes, of course, see you tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwGg">Catherina: Good night, and thanks.</p>

<p id="mwGw">Petro: Good night.</p>

EXERCISE 3: Saying good-bye:</p>

<p id="mwHg">A woman: They're going away right now. What is
he going to say?</p>

<p id="mwHw">A man: Okay, "Good Evening." And what is she going
to say?</p>

<p id="mwIA">A woman: "Good evening. And thanks." Is he gonna
talk about the next day?</p>

<p id="mwIQ">A man: "Will I see you tomorrow? Will we be seeing
each other tomorrow?" What is she going to say?</p>

<p id="mwIg">A woman: "Yes. I'll see you tomorrow. We'll be
seeing each other tomorrow." And as far as he's
concerned, did he like the evening? If this is
true, what would he say?</p>

<p id="mwIw">A man: "Thanks for the very nice evening." And
as far as she is concerned, did she also like the
evening? If this is so, what would she say?</p>

<p id="mwJA">A woman: "I've had a very nice evening." They
are now taking leave of each other. What would
they say in this case?</p>

<p id="mwJQ">A man: Good night.</p>

<p id="mwJg">A woman: Good night.</p>

<p id="mwJw">A man: Sleep well.</p>

<p id="mwKA">A woman: Thanks. You too.</p>

<p id="mwKQ">A man: See you tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwKg">A woman: Yes, see you tomorrow.</p>

<p id="mwKw">Guide: Good. It is now the morning when Catherina
and the entire Geneva office team are going to confer
with Mr. Chahine at his hotel.</p>

<p id="mwLA">SCENE 4: In the Geneva offices and Mr. Chahine's
hotel. Everyone in the office is ready to go to
Mr. Chahine's hotel. Martijn wants some information
from Petro about what he and Catherina did last evening,
but Petro doesn't say anything to him about this.
Catherine arrives at the office. Since her car
is a little small for four people, Martijn offers
to drive Olivero to the hotel in his own car so
that Catherina can go there with Petro in hers.</p>

<p id="mwLQ">When they arrive at the hotel, Catherina calls Mohammed
up in his room to tell him that they have arrived,
and they go up to see him. Mohammed is very happy
to see Catherina, who he hasn't seen for five years.
Catherina introduces Mohammed to her three colleagues.
He invites them into his suite and then orders coffee
for six people.</p>

<p id="mwLg">Martijn: Good morning, Petro.</p>

<p id="mwLw">Petro: Good morning, Martijn.</p>

<p id="mwMA">Martijn: How're you doing?</p>

<p id="mwMQ">Petro: Fine, thanks.</p>

<p id="mwMg">Martijn: Did you have a good time last night?</p>

<p id="mwMw">Petro: Yes, it was nice, thanks.</p>

<p id="mwNA">Martijn: Tell me all about it.</p>

<p id="mwNQ">Petro: What do you mean?</p>

<p id="mwNg">Martijn: I mean, what did you do with the boss?</p>

<p id="mwNw">Petro: Oh, I don't want to talk about it.</p>

<p id="mwOA">Martijn: Okay, fine.</p>

<p id="mwOQ">Catherina: Good morning to all of you.</p>

<p id="mwOg">The others: Good morning.</p>

<p id="mwOw">Catherina: Is everybody ready?</p>

<p id="mwPA">The others: Yes.</p>

<p id="mwPQ">Catherina: We've gotta go to the hotel before too
long.</p>

<p id="mwPg">Martijn: Where's Olivero?</p>

<p id="mwPw">Catherina: He's not in the office right now, but
he's ready. How're we gonna go there? My car's
a little small for all four of us.</p>

<p id="mwQA">Martijn: Okay, ... uh, if you want, I could take
Olivero there in my car, and you and Petro could
go there in yours.</p>

<p id="mwQQ">Petro: Fine.</p>

<p id="mwQg">Martijn: We can meet in the lobby.</p>

<p id="mwQw">Catherina: Good idea.</p>
<p id="mwRA">
<br id="mwRQ"/>
IN THE HOTEL:</p>

<p id="mwRg">Petro: Do you know his room number?</p>

<p id="mwRw">Catherina: He doesn't have a room. He has a suite.</p>

<p id="mwSA">Petro: Really? But do you know its number?</p>

<p id="mwSQ">Catherina: Yes. Five hundred thirteen. I'm gonna
tell the desk clerk that we're going up to see him.
Excuse me.</p>

<p id="mwSg">Desk clerk: Just a minute please. ... What can
I do for you?</p>

<p id="mwSw">Catherina: Can you call up Suite five hundred thirteen
and tell them that we're gonna go up there?</p>

<p id="mwTA">Desk clerk: There's a house phone. It's over there.
Can you see it?</p>

<p id="mwTQ">Catherina: Yes, thanks. Mohammed? (Catherina
goes to the phone.) It's me, Catherina. We're
in the hotel, in the lobby. Yes. Immediately (to
her colleagues) There are the elevators, over there.
Let's go on up.</p>

<p id="mwTg">Petro. Fine.</p>

<p id="mwTw">Catherina: Here's his suite.</p>

<p id="mwUA">Mohammed: Catherina! It's so nice to see you.
How are you?</p>

<p id="mwUQ">Catherina: Just fine, Mohammed, thanks. And you?</p>

<p id="mwUg">Mohammed: Everything's going just fine for me.
Come on in. It's been years since the last time
we saw each other.</p>

<p id="mwUw">Catherina: Yes. It seems to me it's been at least
five years.</p>

<p id="mwVA">Mohammed: And you. Is everything going okay for
you?</p>

<p id="mwVQ">Catherina: Yes, just fine, thanks.</p>

<p id="mwVg">Mohammed: It seems you've brought your entire team
with you.</p>

<p id="mwVw">Catherina: Yes. I'd like to introduce to you Petro,
our engineer.</p>

<p id="mwWA">Petro: Good morning, sir.</p>

<p id="mwWQ">Mohammed: Oh, call me Mohammed.</p>

<p id="mwWg">Catherina: And here's Olivero, our accountant ...</p>

<p id="mwWw">Mohammed: Good morning, Olivero.</p>

<p id="mwXA">Catherina: ... and Martijn, who's in charge of
marketing.</p>

<p id="mwXQ">Mohammed: Good morning, Martijn. Come on in all
of you and have a seat. (Mohammed calls up Room
Service.) Can you bring us some coffee, please?
Thanks. For five people, please. Thanks a lot.</p>

EXERCISE 4: Renewing old acquaintances.</p>

<p id="mwYA">Guide: Catherina and Mohammed seem to be old friends.

<p id="mwYg">Second man: Yes.</p>

<p id="mwYw">First man: She looks a lot like Christina.</p>

him for a long time.</p>

time.</p>

was several years ago.</p>

<p id="mwbg">A woman: Yeah, I think it was three years ago.</p>

<p id="mwbw">Second man: He's gonna correct her.</p>

<p id="mwcA">First man: Oh, much longer than that. I think

met.</p>
