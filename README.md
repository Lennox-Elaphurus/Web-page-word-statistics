## Start

Run Creeper.py or Creeper.exe


## Configuration

Run Creeper first, then it will create a config.txt. You can set the number of processes in it. (It will take effect in the next boot.)

## Stop

To safely stop the Creeper, change the item "terminate" to any string other than "False".
Or you can just close the terminal, which will probably corrupt some record. 

## Maintenance

If you find some messages said the record is corrupted, or you find a data file blank, run maintenance.exe and it will automatically recover the record from latest backup.
